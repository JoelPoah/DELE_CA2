# Describe CGAN
# Try out the improved methods on CGAN 



- [x] Add GlobalAveragePooling2D at the last layer of Discriminators
- [x] label smoothing
- [x] Spectral normalization    

## Eliminating fully connected layers on top of convolutional features
- 



> using GlobalAveragePooling2D at the last lalyer of Discriminators (Radford et al., 2015) (will hurt convergence speed)
- [x] Add batch normalization for both generator and discriminator
## Regularize Discriminator
# Dropout for discriminator 




## FID score
