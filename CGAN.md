# 1.Describe CGAN
# 2. First Touch of CGAN with improved methods from DCGAN 
- [x] LEAKY RELU FOR GENERATOR ( test hypothesis again )
- [x] Batch Normalization
- [x] Spectral normalization    


# 2. Improvements for 2nd CGAN
## Eliminating fully connected layers on top of convolutional features
- [x] Label Smoothing here with (BAM RESEARCH)

> using GlobalAveragePooling2D at the last lalyer of Discriminators (Radford et al., 2015) (will hurt convergence speed)
- [x] Add batch normalization for both generator and discriminator
- [x] Add GlobalAveragePooling2D at the last layer of Discriminators
- [x] Data augmentation

# Mode Collapse happened
BAM RESEARCH PAPER HERE


# 3. Final SNCGAN Model
## Regularize Discriminator
# Dropout for discriminator 




## FID score

## Visually the best





































Inception score
