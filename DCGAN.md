## Pixel Scaling 

 I will be trying out 2 types of scaling ( between 0 and 1 ) AKA normalization vs ( between -1 and 1  AKA Centering)  There is a lot of debate on which one is better and although majority has tried and concluded that Centering is better.  I will still be trying both and see which one works better.

I will first try out the normalization method and then the centering method on model 2


## Describe discriminator

## Describe generator

## train step for dcgan

Tf.gradienttape() 
Pass in a function such as y=x**2 
It will retrieve the gradient of the function which in the above function will be 6

- Why do we need to use gradient tape?
We use gradient tape for faster backpropagation.
