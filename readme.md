# The Process of how I tried out GANs are 
1. DCGAN.ipynb
2. CGAN.ipynb
3.WGAN.ipynb


## Goal
> Create 1000 images of the cifar 10 dataset using the most appropriate GAN model. After researching and testing out the various GAN models, I found that the CGAN model with Spectral Normalization aka SNCGAN was the most appropriate for this task.



# Results
` 100 images of eahc class of cifar 10 dataset`
